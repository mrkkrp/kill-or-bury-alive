Have you ever killed a buffer that you might want to leave alive? Motivation
for killing is usually “get out of my way for now”, and killing may be not
the best choice in many cases unless your RAM is very-very limited. This
package allows to teach Emacs which buffers to kill and which to bury alive.

When we really want to kill a buffer, it turns out that not all buffers
would like to die the same way. The package allows to specify *how* to kill
various kinds of buffers. This may be especially useful when you're working
with some buffer that has an associated process, for example.

Sometimes you may want to get rid of most buffers and bring Emacs to some
more-or-less virgin state. You probably don't want to kill scratch buffer
and maybe ERC-related buffers too. You can specify which buffers to purge.

## Installation

Download this package and place it somewhere, so Emacs can see it. Then put
`(require 'kill-or-bury-alive)` into your configuration file. Done!

To install the package via MELPA, execute: <kbd>M-x package-install RET
kill-or-bury-alive RET</kbd>.

## Usage

All you need to do to start using the package is to bind two useful
functions: `kill-or-bury-alive` and `kill-or-bury-alive-purge-buffers`.

I've noticed that many people only ever want to kill the current buffer.
They even rebind <kbd>C-x k</kbd> to `kill-this-buffer`. This makes sense,
it's natural for us to care about buffers that are visible and active. It's
also intuitive to switch to some buffer before killing it. If you are into
this sort of workflow, you can add something like this to your
initialization file (if you want to preserve the original `kill-buffer`,
choose a different key binding):

```emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x k") #'kill-or-bury-alive)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c p") #'kill-or-bury-alive-purge-buffers)
```

The second function purges all buffers (see description below). <kbd>C-c
p</kbd> is just a key binding that I use myself, you can choose whatever you
like, of course.

## API

Before I describe the API, you need to know about a notion that this package
uses: *buffer designator*.

*Buffer designator* is something that can define a particular kind of
buffers. In `kill-or-bury-alive` buffer designator is either:

* a string—a regular expression to match name of buffer, this sort of buffer
  designator represents all buffers with matching names;

* a symbol—major mode of buffer, this represents all buffers that have such
  major mode and modes derived from it.

----

```
kill-or-bury-alive-kill-with buffer-designator killing-function &optional simple
```

Kill buffers selected by `buffer-designator` with `killing-function`.

Normally, `killing-function` should be able to take one argument: buffer
object. However, you can use a function that operates on current buffer and
doesn't take any arguments. Just pass non-`nil` `simple` argument and
`killing-function` will be wrapped as needed automatically.

*This function should be used to configure the package, it cannot be called
interactively.*

----

```
kill-or-bury-alive &optional arg
```

Kill or bury current buffer.

This is a universal killing mechanism. When argument `arg` is given and it's
not `nil`, kill current buffer. Otherwise behavior of this command varies.
If current buffer matches a buffer designator listed in
`kill-or-bury-alive-must-die-list`, kill it immediately, otherwise just bury
it.

You can specify how to kill various kinds of buffers, see
`kill-or-bury-alive-killing-function-alist` for more information. Buffers
are killed with `kill-or-bury-alive-killing-function` by default.

----

```
kill-or-bury-alive-purge-buffers &optional arg
```

Kill all buffers except for long lasting ones.

Long lasting buffers are specified in `kill-or-bury-alive-long-lasting-list`.

If `kill-or-bury-alive-base-buffer` is not `nil`, switch to buffer with that
name after purging and delete all other windows.

When `arg` is given and it's not `nil`, ask to confirm killing of every
buffer.

## Customization

This package can be customized via the customization system. Type <kbd>M-x
customize-group RET kill-or-bury-alive RET</kbd> to try it.

There are quite a few variables that you can modify to control behavior of
`kill-or-bury-alive` package. Let's list them (we list their default values
too after ‘⇒’ character).

----

```
kill-or-bury-alive-must-die-list ⇒ nil
```

List of buffer designators for buffers that always should be killed.

This variable is used by `kill-or-bury-alive` function.

----

```
kill-or-bury-alive-killing-function-alist ⇒ nil
```

AList that maps buffer designators to functions that should kill them.

This variable is used by `kill-or-bury-alive` and
`kill-or-bury-alive-purge-buffers`.

You can use `kill-or-bury-alive-kill-with` to add elements to this alist.

----

```
kill-or-bury-alive-long-lasting-list ⇒
  ("^\\*scratch\\*$"
   "^\\*Messages\\*$"
   "^\\*git-credential-cache--daemon\\*$"
   erc-mode)
```

List of buffer designators for buffers that should not be purged.

This variable is used by `kill-or-bury-alive-purge-buffers`.

----

```
kill-or-bury-alive-killing-function ⇒ nil
```

The default function for buffer killing.

This is used when nothing is found in
`kill-or-bury-alive-killing-function-alist`.

The function should be able to take one argument: buffer object to kill or
its name.

If value of the variable is `nil`, `kill-buffer` is used.

----

```
kill-or-bury-alive-burying-function ⇒ nil
```

Function used by `kill-or-bury-alive` to bury a buffer.

The function should be able to take one argument: buffer object to bury or
its name.

If value of the variable is `nil`, `kill-or-bury-alive--bury-buffer*` is
used.

----

```
kill-or-bury-alive-base-buffer ⇒ "*scratch*"
```

Name of the buffer to switch to after `kill-or-bury-alive-purge-buffers`.
